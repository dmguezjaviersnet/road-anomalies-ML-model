# road-anomalies-ML-model
ML approach to identify and classify potential road anomalies using smartphone sensors.

## Objectives

Our main goal is to use sensors such as accelerometer, gyroscope, etc to spot anomalies on the road by analizing the time series that 
stem from the sampling of such integrated sensors. Such time series will be generated by a smartphone running a simple Flutter 
app while driving in a vehicle.

We will collect data and train a Machine Learning Model to recognize patterns in those time series that can be an indication of an
anomaly being present.

We intend to use GPS as a way to stablish ground truth once a vehicle drive over an anomaly and to provide information as to where
an anomaly is located approximately.
